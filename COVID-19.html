                         <p>According to the World Health Organization, Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)</p>

                          <P>According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA,  patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections have reported mild to severe respiratory illnesses with symptoms including:</P>
                          <ul></ul>
                          <li> Fever
                        <li>Cough

                          </div>
                          <P class="only">CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses.</P>
                          <h2> How Coronavirus is Spread</h2>
                          <P >The CDC states that coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through:</P>
                          <ul>
                            <li>the air by coughing and sneezing
                              <li>close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands
                                <li>touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands
                                  <li>rarely, fecal contamination
                                  </ul>
                                 <p> Currently, itâ€™s unclear how easily or sustainably COVID-19 is spreading between people. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</p>

                           <h1>How to help protect from the Coronavirus</h1>
                           <p>The best way to protect yourself is avoid being exposed to the virus. The CDC always recommends[v] simple everyday preventative steps to help prevent the spread of respiratory virus, including:</p>
                           <ul><li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
                            <li> Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                              <li> Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
                                <li> Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces
                                  <li>Stay home when you are sick
                                    <li> Cover your cough or sneeze, preferably with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the bin
                                      </li>
                                      <p>As with all infectious diseases, good hygiene can play a role in controlling its spread. However, the most important public health recommendation is that people report to the nearest health care provider if they develop any symptoms indicative of Coronavirus. Call the office of your health care provider before you go and tell them about any previous travel and your symptoms. They will give you instructions on how to get care without exposing other people to your illness.</p>

                                      <h2>Does Dettol kill the Coronavirus (COVID-19)?</h2>
                                      <p>Specific Dettol products have demonstrated effectiveness (>99.9% inactivation) against coronavirus strains from the same family as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in third party laboratory testing, when used in accordance with the directions for use.  These products are: Dettol Antibacterial Surface Cleanser Spray, Dettol Antibacterial Surface Cleanser Wipes, Dettol All-In-One Disinfectant Spray, and Dettol Disinfectant Liquid.

                                        Given the structural similarities of the COVID-19 virus to the coronavirus strains tested previously (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human Coronavirus), and based on the evidence available to us, we would expect our Dettol products (listed above) to be effective against the new strain. Definitive scientific confirmation of this, as with all other commercially available virucides, can only be provided once testing against COVID-19 Coronavirus has been conducted, following release of the strain by relevant health authorities. 
                                        
                                        The CDC and World Health Organization specifically advises people to wash hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer as a key preventative measure against the spread Coronavirus COVID-19. A good quality disinfectant will help reduce risk to families. Our Dettol Hand Sanitizers use ethanol (alcohol) as the germ disinfection active ingredient in line with CDC and WHO recommendations.</p>
